# MakeMeAdmin
App-Script solution for making a regular user admin for 2 hours

You need to create and install an individual configuration profile for each computer containing the user account name in the tag user_longname or change the script at line 20 to compare the current users shortname with something else.

You need to be admin to install it, so it won't make you admin unless an admin has installed it on your computer.

Feel free to use it as you like but don't blame me if things don't work or breaks.
Read the code before you install it and tweak the code to your need.
Have fun and keep coding.
